# Treetracker iOS

## Project Details

This is the iOS app for the TreeTracker open source project (www.treetracker.org).
This project coordinates tree planting employment for people living in extreme poverty.
The iOS segment allows people to track and verify reforestation plantings,
paying planters on a per planting basis.

For more on design intent and the app's user story see the [wiki in this repository](https://github.com/Greenstand/treetracker-android/wiki/User-Story)

## Project Setup
### Dependencies
Dependencies are managed using [CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/) and are checked into to repository.

### SwiftLint
[SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) is used to keep the codebase consistent. Rules can be configured or disabled in the [.swiftlint.yml](.swiftlint.yml) file.

### SwiftGen
[SwiftGen](https://github.com/SwiftGen/SwiftGen) is used to auto-generate code for resources (e.g. Storyboards, Assets, Strings etc), to make them type-safe to use. This can be configured in the [swiftgen.yml](swiftgen.yml) file.
