# Treetracker iOS

## Project Details

This is the iOS app for the TreeTracker open source project (www.treetracker.org).
This project coordinates tree planting employment for people living in extreme poverty.
The iOS segment allows people to track and verify reforestation plantings,
paying planters on a per planting basis.
